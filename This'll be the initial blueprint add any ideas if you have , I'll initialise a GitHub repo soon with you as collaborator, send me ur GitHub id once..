The application enables students to list books they own and borrow books from others. Each student can create an account, list available books, browse the books others have listed, and request to borrow or lend books.


2. Core Features:

1. User Authentication:

Sign Up/Log In: Students sign up using their VIT student email (with domain verification), and log in using their credentials.

Profile Creation: A user profile with basic info like name, department, year of study, and contact details.

Authentication: Use JWT for secure login sessions.



2. Book Listings:

Add a Book: Users can list a book with details like title, author, condition, and availability.

Search Books: Filter and search books by title, author, category, or owner.

Book Availability: Mark books as "Available" or "On Loan" to reflect current status.



3. Book Lending/Request:

Request a Book: Students can send a borrow request for a book.

Approve/Reject Requests: The book owner can accept or decline borrow requests.

Borrow History: Keep track of past borrowed/lent books.



4. Notifications:

Notifications for book requests, approvals, and returns.



5. Messaging System:

Direct Messages: Once a request is approved, enable a chat between the borrower and lender for logistics like meetup location, return date, etc.



6. Ratings/Reviews:

Users can leave feedback on both the borrower and lender after a transaction.

  "category": String,
  "createdAt": Date,
  "updatedAt": Date
}

Transactions Collection:

{
  "_id": ObjectId,

  "updatedAt": Date
}

Messages Collection:

{
  "_id": ObjectId,
